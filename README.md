# Automatic Blob Updater

It all started when [@DerpGang](https://github.com/DerpGang) was blaming me for kanging vendor from others, well others were okay with it, but these guys weren't. And I was too lazy to pull vendor myself. Thanks to DerpGang, I worked on this.

Well DroneCI made things so easy, I had so much freedom than other CI Services!
